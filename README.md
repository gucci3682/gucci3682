# Hi, nice to meet you! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" height="40px" width="40px">

I am a Business Analytics graduate with a stronger interest for programming than data analytics (oops). Currently, I am more specialised in backend programming but I am in the midst of developing myself to pursue my final goal of becoming a fullstack developer!
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my personal portfolio website (better late than never I guess)
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React and React Native
ðŸ’» Open to all software programming opportunities!
